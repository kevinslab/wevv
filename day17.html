<h1>What was it like in ancient egypt?</h1>
<p>Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa. It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)[1] with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).[2] The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as "Intermediate Periods". The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age, or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.<br><br>

Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant. After this period, it entered an era of slow decline. During the course of its history, ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom, formed in the aftermath of Alexander's death, ruled until 30 BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.[3] Egypt remained under Roman control until the 640s AD, when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate.<br><br>

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.[4]<br><br>

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying, and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems, and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats,[5] Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites.[6] Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia. A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.[7]<br><br>

History
Main articles: History of ancient Egypt and Population history of Egypt
The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.[8] The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.[9] Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa had become increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.</p>

<h2><p id="amaz">Egypt (Arabic: ŸÖÿµÿ± Mi·π£r [mesÀÅr], Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [m…ësÀ§r]), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and the Sinai Peninsula in the southwest corner of Asia. It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip of Palestine and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt, while Alexandria, the second-largest city, is an important industrial and tourist hub at the Mediterranean coast.[20] At approximately 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the 14th-most populated country in the world, and the third-most populated in Africa.<br><br>

Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 6th‚Äì4th millennia BCE. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.[21] Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity, later adopting Islam from the seventh century onwards. Cairo became the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in the tenth century, and of the Mamluk Sultanate in the 13th century. Egypt then became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, before its local ruler Muhammad Ali established modern Egypt as an autonomous Khedivate in 1867.<br><br>

The country was then occupied by the British Empire and gained independence in 1922 as a monarchy. Following the 1952 revolution, Egypt declared itself a republic. For a brief period between 1958 and 1961 Egypt merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic. Egypt fought several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and occupied the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. In 1978, Egypt signed the Camp David Accords, which recognised Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from the occupied Sinai. After the Arab Spring, which led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the country faced a protracted period of political unrest; this included the election in 2012 of a brief, short-lived Muslim Brotherhood-aligned Islamist government spearheaded by Mohamed Morsi, and its subsequent overthrow after mass protests in 2013.<br><br>

Egypt's current government, a semi-presidential republic led by president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi since he was elected in 2014, has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian and responsible for perpetuating the country's poor human rights record. Islam is the official religion of Egypt, and Arabic is its official language.[1] The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About 43% of Egypt's residents live across the country's urban areas,[22] with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. Egypt is considered to be a regional power in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world, and a middle power worldwide.[23] It is a developing country having a diversified economy, which is the largest in Africa, the 38th-largest economy by nominal GDP and 127th by nominal GDP per capita.[24] Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab League, the African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, World Youth Forum, and a member of BRICS.<br><br>

Names
The English name "Egypt" is derived from the Ancient Greek "A√≠gyptos" ("Œë·º¥Œ≥œÖœÄœÑŒøœÇ"), via Middle French "Egypte" and Latin "Aegyptus". It is reflected in early Greek Linear B tablets as "a-ku-pi-ti-yo".[25] The adjective "aig√Ωpti-"/"aig√Ωptios" was borrowed into Coptic as "gyptios", and from there into Arabic as "qub·π≠ƒ´", back formed into "ŸÇÿ®ÿ∑" ("qub·π≠"), whence English "Copt". Prominent Ancient Greek historian and Geographer, Strabo, provided a folk etymology stating that "Œë·º¥Œ≥œÖœÄœÑŒøœÇ" (Aig√Ωptios) had originally evolved as a compound from "A·º∞Œ≥Œ±ŒØŒøœÖ ·ΩëœÄœÑŒØœâœÇ" Aegaeou hupti≈çs, meaning "Below the Aegean".[26]<br><br>

"Mi·π£r" (Arabic pronunciation: [misÀ§…æ]; "ŸÖŸêÿµÿ±") is the Classical Quranic Arabic and modern official name of Egypt, while "Ma·π£r" (Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [m…ësÀ§…æ]; ŸÖŸéÿµÿ±) is the local pronunciation in Egyptian Arabic.[27] The current name of Egypt, Misr/Misir/Misru, stems from the Ancient Semitic name for it. The term originally connoted "Civilization" or "Metropolis".[28] Classical Arabic Mi·π£r (Egyptian Arabic Ma·π£r) is directly cognate with the Biblical Hebrew Mitsr√°yƒ´m (◊û÷¥◊¶÷∞◊®÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù / ◊û÷¥◊¶÷∞◊®÷∏◊ô÷¥◊ù), meaning "the two straits", a reference to the predynastic separation of Upper and Lower Egypt. Also mentioned in several Semitic languages as Mesru, Misir and Masar.[28] The oldest attestation of this name for Egypt is the Akkadian "mi-i·π£-ru" ("mi·π£ru")[29][30] related to mi·π£ru/mi·π£irru/mi·π£aru, meaning "border" or "frontier".[31] The Neo-Assyrian Empire used the derived term , Mu-·π£ur.[32]<br><br>

The ancient Egyptian name of the country was 
km	m	t
O49
 (ìÜé ìÖì ìèèìäñ) km.t, which means black land, likely referring to the fertile black soils of the Nile flood plains, distinct from the deshret (‚ü®d≈°·πõt‚ü©), or "red land" of the desert.[33][34] This name is commonly vocalised as Kemet, but was probably pronounced [kuÀêmat] in ancient Egyptian.[35] The name is realised as K(h)ƒìm…ô (Bohairic Coptic: ‚≤≠‚≤è‚≤ô‚≤ì, Sahidic Coptic: ‚≤ï‚≤è‚≤ô‚≤â) in the Coptic stage of the Egyptian language, and appeared in early Greek as ŒßŒ∑ŒºŒØŒ± (Khƒìm√≠a).[36][37] Another name was ‚ü®tÍú£-mry‚ü© "land of the riverbank".[38] The names of Upper and Lower Egypt were Ta-Sheme'aw (‚ü®tÍú£-≈°mÍú•w‚ü©) "sedgeland" and Ta-Mehew (‚ü®tÍú£ m·∏•w‚ü©) "northland", respectively.<br><br></p></h2>
